<h1>About</h1>

<p>
This blog about tech, reason, and the infinite complexities
of the universe, although the infinite part is under examination.
It is also a place for me to practice writing and expressing my
ideas and for people to brutally judge me on them. I quite enjoy
my ideas judged and analyzed, so don't be too soft.
</p>

<p>
Here's a list of things I'm interested in:
<ul>
    <li>Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Exploring thoughts and morals</li>
    <li>Poi</li>
    <li>Computers and tech</li>
    <li>Optimization</li>
</ul>
